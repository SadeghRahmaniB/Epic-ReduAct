Epic-ReduAct dataset

We carefully curated a dataset for comparison human and AI vision capabilities called Epic ReduAct. We used videos from the standard ego-centric kitchen activity dataset, Epic-Kitchens-100 (https://epic-kitchens.github.io/2025), and systematically reduced the available spatial and temporal information.
